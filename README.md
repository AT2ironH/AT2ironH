<h4>I'm a fresh graduate from Ironhack's Fullstack Web development bootcamp 👨‍🎓 Looking to dive deep in the coding waters and make the most of it!
Former QA tester background gives me a good perspective of seeing both sides of the coding coin. So from chasing bugs and trying to crash apps I went into fixing bugs and developing apps 🐛🔨<h4/>
